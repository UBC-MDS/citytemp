# Proposal

## Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

Our role: Data scientist consultancy firm

Target audience: Weather-savvy travel enthusiasts who would like to have a fun-filled experience by planning well in advance for optimal weather conditions.

Travel enthusiasts who dream about having unforgettable experiences are usually worried about getting caught in unexpected weather conditions like heat waves or heavy downpours. It can be a daunting experience, especially for those who are planning international trips, if they are not well prepared in terms of clothing and travel gear to accommodate the unpredictable weather. Since unexpected weather could make or break a trip, our proposed dashboard would be a reliable tool that can help millions of people all over the world who love traveling to embark on memorable adventures to the US by providing them with weather information. The proposed dashboard is a one-stop shop for finding relevant information like temperature and precipitation levels across different areas in the United States, which can also be filtered based on city, state, and month. The dashboard will also showcase insightful heat map visualization for different states in the US, which can let the user know which state/city has high temperatures and which ones have low temperatures on average. There will be a provision to check the highest, lowest, and average temperatures in each area based on city and month. All in all, we aim to enable travelers to take informed decisions on which areas to visit and plan activities accordingly for their trip and make the most of their trip to the US without having weather-related surprises.

## Section 2: Description of the data

In this project, we are using the daily weather data collected by the USA National Weather Service and shared by the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project by the R4DS Online Learning community.

## Section 3: Research questions and usage scenarios

Our project answers the broad research question of: “How do temperature and precipitation levels vary across different regions of the United States during different months of the
year?”. Below we have provided a usage scenario of our product by a member of our target audience:

Jack is a travel enthusiast who loves exploring new places and experiencing different climates. As someone who's always on the go, Jack wants to be prepared for whatever weather
conditions he may encounter on his travels. That's where our proposed dashboard comes in.

Using the dashboard's map feature, Jack can easily visualize the temperature and precipitation levels of various states and regions he plans to visit, giving him a better idea of
what to expect and helping him pack accordingly. The diverging color palette makes it easy to distinguish between areas with low, medium, and high levels, so Jack can quickly
identify areas that may require additional preparations.

The bar chart feature also comes in handy, showing Jack the top 10 states or cities with the highest temperature or precipitation levels. This gives him insight into areas that
may be particularly hot or rainy, allowing him to adjust his itinerary accordingly.

But what if Jack wants to dive deeper into the data and understand the temperature and precipitation trends of specific states or cities? The line plot feature with the
dashboard's filtering options allows him to do just that. By selecting a state or city and a specific month, Jack can see how temperature and precipitation levels have changed
over time. He can also view summary statistics such as highest, lowest, and average temperatures of various cities from the boxes ,giving him a better understanding of what to
expect during his travels.

Overall, our proposed dashboard provides Jack with the information he needs to plan his trips effectively and be prepared for any weather conditions he may encounter. It's an
invaluable tool for any traveler who wants to make the most out of their adventures while staying safe and comfortable.
