## Research questions and usage scenarios

Jack is a travel enthusiast who loves exploring new places and experiencing different climates. As someone who's always on the go, Jack wants to be prepared for whatever weather
conditions he may encounter on his travels. That's where our proposed dashboard comes in.

Using the dashboard's map feature, Jack can easily visualize the temperature and precipitation levels of various states and regions he plans to visit, giving him a better idea of
what to expect and helping him pack accordingly. The diverging color palette makes it easy to distinguish between areas with low, medium, and high levels, so Jack can quickly
identify areas that may require additional preparations.

The bar chart feature also comes in handy, showing Jack the top 10 states or cities with the highest temperature or precipitation levels. This gives him insight into areas that
may be particularly hot or rainy, allowing him to adjust his itinerary accordingly.

But what if Jack wants to dive deeper into the data and understand the temperature and precipitation trends of specific states or cities? The line plot feature with the
dashboard's filtering options allows him to do just that. By selecting a state or city and a specific month, Jack can see how temperature and precipitation levels have changed
over time, giving him a better understanding of what to expect during his travels.

Overall, our proposed dashboard provides Jack with the information he needs to plan his trips effectively and be prepared for any weather conditions he may encounter. It's an
invaluable tool for any traveler who wants to make the most out of their adventures while staying safe and comfortable.
