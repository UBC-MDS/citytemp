# Project teamwork contract
*Course: UBC MDS DSCI 532 - Data Visualization II*

### Team Members
* Eyre Hong  
* Renne Kwon
* Sneha Sunil
* Vincent Ho 

## Expectations and Ground Rules

All group members will contribute their best efforts to ensure the project's success. We will endeavour to distribute the work evenly while taking into consideration each member's preferences and skillset. All members collectively hold the responsibility to ensure our deliverables are correct and complete, even if they did not personally work on them.

## Weekly Schedule & Deadlines
**Monday 2 PM - 6 PM** - Group meets to discuss the next milestone and divide the deliverables during the designated lab times. We may stay late to work out something complex together.
**Friday 6 PM** - Deadline for weekly deliverables.
**Saturday 12 - 6 PM** - Team members will check in remotely to merge our code, resolve any issues, and check over the final submission.

- Members should expect to spend upwards of an hour each Saturday afternoon finalizing our submission.

## Submission Details

Each team member will be responsible to do a submission for a milestone (in total 4 milestones). The team member who is responsible to do the submission should also take care of managing the GitHub repo. For example, open and close the issues, set up the project board and milestone deadlines etc.

## Communication and Conflict Management

All communication outside of the meetings will be through Github and Slack. GitHub will be the primary communication tool for ideas, suggestions, submitting work and reviewing work. We will manage deliverables through Github Issues, Milestones, and the GitHub Project. Slack will be the communication tool for informal communication and scheduling meetings. 

## Breach of Contract
Failure to follow the team contract will result in a three-step warning system:
	1. The first step is a written Slack notice that outlines the violation of the team contract and a reminder of the team contract conditions.
	2. The second step is a meeting to discuss the behaviour and write an agreement to follow the team contract required by the member.
	3. The third step is to reach out to the lab instructor or TAs about the issues with the teammate
