# Reflection


## What went well?

The project successfully tied the plots to the drop-down menus and fill-in options provided to users. The fundamental functionalists of the proposed plots were also implemented, and the overall design of the dashboard resembles it well. 

We were able to create two tabs: City Map with Temp/Rain Trends, and City Ranking by Temp/Rain. The City Map with Temp/Rain Trends tab allows users to select a range of months, cities and states, and observe temperature or precipitation levels. The app then presents summary metrics, a map showing the average temperature or precipitation levels, and a line plot showing the temperature or precipitation distribution. The City Ranking by Temp/Rain tab enables users to select a US state, and a specific month, and observe high or low temperature/precipitation records for the top 10 cities in that state.

## What changed?

Originally, our aim was to create a map that shows the differences in temperature and precipitation by the state for a specific month. However, after considering that our data is primarily city-based and our dashboard is named `citytemp`, we decided to focus on displaying temperature and precipitation differences by cities instead.

## Future improvements

Although we are satisfied with the functionalists we have implemented so far, there are still areas where we can improve the `citytemp` app. Firstly, we plan to redesign the app layout and theme to make it more aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly. Additionally, as our data only covers the period between `Jan 2021` and `Jun 2022`, we need to reconsider the range and label for the month range sliding window to provide users with a better understanding of the data's temporal limitation. We will also need to inform our dashboard of these limitations to ensure users could have a more general idea when using our dashboard.

Overall, this was a valuable learning experience and the team is satisfied with what has been accomplished thus far.
