## Overview

Citytemp dashboard is designed to assist travel enthusiasts in understanding weather fluctuations, temperatures, and precipitation levels across various states/cities in the United States based on historical data to enable them to plan well for their upcoming trips to avoid weather disruptions.
## Description

Our proposed dashboard is designed to present a visual analysis of observed temperature and precipitation data from the [weather_forcasts.csv](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-12-20/weather_forecasts.csv) in tidytuesday. Specifically, our dashboard is focused on displaying a visual analysis of the two key variables: observed temperature and observed precipitation that are contained within the dataset. The visualizations that we will include are:

1. A map that shows the temperature or precipitation by state. The states will be coloured as a diverging colour palette to identify countries with low, medium, and high levels.
2. A bar chart that shows the top 10 states/cities with the highest temperature/precipitation.
3. A line plot that shows the distribution of temperature/precipitation of a certain states/cities.
4. Boxes showing summary statistics such as highest, lowest and average temperatures of various states/cities.

In addition, our dashboard will offer various filtering options to customize the displayed visualizations and enable the user to manipulate the data as desired.

1. A checkbox that allows users to choose to view either temperature or precipitation data.
2. A slider that allows users to select a single month to visualize.
3. A filter that allows users to select a state to visualize.
4. A filter that allows users to select a city to visualize, if desired.

These options will allow users to identify trends in temperature/precipitation over time in the desired state or city, making it easier to observe how temperature/precipitation and related visualizations have changed across different regions in the United States.
