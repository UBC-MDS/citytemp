## Purpose and Motivation

Being unprepared for certain weather conditions can make or break a trip. Our motivation with citytemp was to create a realiable tool that US travelers can use to make informed decisions on which areas to visit and plan activities accordingly during their travels. Our app uses real historical data to assist travel enthusiasts in understanding weather fluctuations, temperatures, and precipitation levels across various states/cities in the United States and enables them to plan well for their upcoming trips to avoid weather disruptions and unwanted suprises.

## Dashboard Preview and Description

[--- GIF will go here --]

Our dashboard is presents observed temperature and precipitation data from the [weather_forcasts.csv](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-12-20/weather_forecasts.csv) in tidytuesday. 

Users can select the duration of months, state, and city of interest and our app will present the following: 

1. Summary metrics including average, mininimum, and maximum temperature/precipitation. 
2. A map showing average temperature or precipitation levels based on the range chosen by the user. 
City points are coloured from low to high temperature or precipitation levels. 
3. A line plot showing the distribution of low and high observed temperatures and precipitation levels. 
4. Bar charts displaying the top 10 cities in the chosen state with the highest or lowest average temperature/precipitation.

Citytemp's visualizations allow user to easily observe and identify trends in temperature/precipitation over time in their chosen state or city.
